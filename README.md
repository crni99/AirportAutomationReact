# Airport Automation React App [![Node.js CI](https://github.com/crni99/AirportAutomationReact/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crni99/AirportAutomationReact/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive React application that interfaces seamlessly with the Airport Automation API. This app aims to provide users with an intuitive and efficient experience. Below are the key components and practices incorporated into the application:

### User Interface Design:
- Implementing a responsive and user-friendly layout using modern React practices.

### State Management:
- Managing application state with Context API or Redux for a smooth data flow and user interactions.
- Handling asynchronous data fetching in JavaScript using the native fetch API.

### Fetching and Displaying Data:
- Integrating with the [AirportAutomationAPI](https://github.com/crni99/AirportAutomation) to retrieve, display, and manipulate data such as flight information, passenger details, and airport resources.
- Implementing dynamic components to render data based on user interactions.

### Form Handling and Validation:
- Creating forms for user input (e.g., booking flights, managing reservations) with validation using libraries like React Hook Form.
- Providing real-time feedback and error handling for a better user experience.

### Routing and Navigation:
- Utilizing React Router for smooth navigation between different views (e.g., home, flights).
- Implementing nested routes for organized and maintainable code.

### Security and Authentication:
- Incorporating authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT) to secure user sessions and sensitive data.
- Implementing role-based access control to manage user permissions.

### Performance Optimization:
- Applying techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and memoization to enhance application performance.
- Monitoring and optimizing component rendering to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Deployment and Monitoring:
- Deploying the application on Vercel.
- Implementing logging and monitoring for application health and performance.
