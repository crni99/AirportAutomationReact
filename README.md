In this project, I developed a modern, single-page React application as part of the Airport Automation system. It provides a dynamic and responsive user experience while communicating directly with the [AirportAutomationAPI](https://github.com/crni99/AirportAutomation). The application focuses on delivering real-time airport management features with intuitive UX and secure interaction patterns.

### üé® User Interface Design
- Built with functional components and React Hooks.
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout using modern styling techniques.

### üîÑ State Management
- Application state is managed via Context API or Redux.
- Efficient handling of asynchronous operations using the native `fetch` API and middleware when necessary.

### üì° Data Fetching and Integration
- Full integration with the backend API to retrieve and manage data such as flights, passengers, and airport operations.
- Dynamic rendering of components based on API responses and user interaction.

### üìù Form Handling and Validation
- Form inputs (e.g., bookings, user data) managed with **React Hook Form**.
- Real-time validation with user-friendly error handling and feedback.

### üß≠ Routing and Navigation
- Navigation handled via **React Router**, including dynamic and nested routes for scalability.
- Seamless page transitions without full reloads.

### üîê Security and Authentication
- Secure user login with **JWT-based authentication**.
- Role-based access control for restricting features based on user permissions.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Performance improvements through **lazy loading**, **code splitting**, and **memoization**.
- Optimized re-renders using React best practices to enhance responsiveness.

### üöÄ Deployment and Monitoring
- Deployed to both **[Vercel](https://airport-automation-react.vercel.app/)** and **[Netlify](https://airport-automation-react.netlify.app/)** for high availability.
- Integrated basic logging and monitoring to track app health and errors in production environments.
